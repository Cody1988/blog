/**
 * <h1>Maximum difference of zeros and ones in binary string | Set 2 (O(n)
 * time)</h1>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Given a binary string of 0s and 1s. The task is to find the length of
 * substring which is having a maximum difference of number of 0s and number of
 * 1s (number of 0s â€“ number of 1s). In case of all 1s print -1.
 * </p>
 * Examples:
 * 
 * <pre>

Input : S = "11000010001"
Output : 6
From index 2 to index 9, there are 7
0s and 1 1s, so number of 0s - number
of 1s is 6.

Input : S = "1111"
Output : -1
 * </pre>
