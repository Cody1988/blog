The load balancing architecture here is very very simple. There is a single load balancer with its own reggie running at 6670. This is the primary contact point for all clients.

There are multiple reggie involved for load balancing. The following convention is followed:

1. The reggie for load balancer is at 6670
2. The reggie for the actual jini servers are at 5561, 5562, 5563, etc.

When the load-balancer recieves a request from client, it does the look-up at the appropriate jini-server and returns the remote service.
